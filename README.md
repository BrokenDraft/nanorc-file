**This is my nano config file which include :**


*  Soft tab (spaces).

*  Tab = 4.

*  some simple coloration to separate the user from the root.

*  Mouse interaction when possible.


**How to set it up automatically?**

* give the appropriate permissions to the "add_nanorc" script file, and execute it : 

# ./add_nanorc
